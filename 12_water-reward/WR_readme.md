# Water Reward Compartment

The water reward compartment within the microstimulation setup comprises distinct components crucial for precise and controlled delivery of rewards to the subject, usually a rodent, during experimental tasks. Each component serves a specific function in managing and administering the water reward.

## Components and Functionality

1. **Piezo Sensor Lick Detector:** This sensor is utilized to detect and register the subject's licking response. Piezo sensors convert mechanical pressure (in this case, the licking action) into electrical signals, triggering the delivery of the water reward upon the desired behavior completion.

2. **Multitool:** A workshop-provided tool utilized for managing the release of the water reward. It operates in conjunction with other components, facilitating controlled and timed delivery.

3. **Solenoid:** A separate component responsible for controlling the water flow. The solenoid regulates the water release triggered by the multitool's mechanism.

4. **Tubing:** The conduit through which the water reward is delivered from the source (water container) to the subject's access point.

## Special Considerations for Components

- **Lick Detector Holder:** Essential for the piezo sensor's placement, ensuring flexibility to accommodate variations among subjects. This holder's adaptability is crucial for positioning the sensor accurately for consistent detection.

### Working with Water: Safety Warning

Working with water in the experimental setup requires careful attention and adherence to safety protocols:

- **Electrical Safety:** Ensure all electrical components involved in water management are properly insulated and protected to prevent electrical hazards.
  
- **Hygiene and Contamination:** Regularly maintain and sterilize components that come into contact with water to prevent contamination and ensure the subject's health and safety.
  
- **Waste Disposal:** Dispose of used water responsibly to avoid environmental impact and maintain laboratory cleanliness.

Maintaining a safe working environment when handling water in the experimental setup is essential to safeguard both experimental integrity and the well-being of the subjects involved.
