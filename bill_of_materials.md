## Component description
|Component| Description|
|--------|-------|
|Headbar holder| Head restrainer that will keep the head of the animal fixed during the experiment. A simple thumbscrew allows you to release or secure the headbar. *Optional 3D*|
|Lick-detector| Piezo sensor that converts licking to an electrical signal that is amplified and picked up by the multitool. *IR/Piezo*|
|Multitool| Amplifies and thresholds the signal that is detected by the lick-detector. If the threshold is met a block pulse is send to open the solenoid for a set amount of time.|
|Solenoid| Controls the dispensation of a water reward by un-clamping the tubing.|
|Stimulus isolator with charger| Delivers positive, negative or bipolar currents. Pulse duration is controlled by an externally applied voltage.|
|Electrode| Tungsten electrode with heat-treated tapered tip. This is connected to the stimulus isolater and inserted into the brain to inject a current.|
|Electrode holder| Metal rod with an adjustable clamping mechanism for holding the electrode.|
|Micromanipulator| Device that controls the movement of the electrode. Movement can be made in 3 dimensions (x,y,z) on a control pad and is reduced to micrometers.|
|Grayscale camera| Low-light monochromatic camera used for capturing video footage of the face/pupil.|
|RGB camera| Color camera used for capturing video footage of the UV-painted whiskers.|
|Camera holder| Adaptor that can be screwed into the camera. Allows for positioning of the camera to a rod.|
|IR light| Infrared (780nm) LED.|
|UV light| UV (380nm) LED.|
