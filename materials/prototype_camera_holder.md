# Camera holder prototyping
## Initial version

Step 1: Hypothesis
- Currently, the holder for the cameras is in the form of a metal plate that can be attached to the bottom. However, I beleive that it is possible to replace this by a 3D printed attachement. 
- This would reduce the costs and the time spend waiting for it to arrive. Additionally, multiple versions can be created to allow for a flexible implementation.

Step 2: Test
- To verify that, we will replicate the metal camera holder in 3D printed form. ![](https://i.imgur.com/qLYP8cf.png)
- â‚¬
- Current version is not reliable at all as it doesn't take camera dimensions into account.

Step3: Metric
- And measure how tightly the holder can be attached to the camera

Step 4: Criteria
We are right if the camera holder can securely be connected to the camera and can be tightened to a rod.
