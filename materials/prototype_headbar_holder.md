# Headpost holder prototyping
## Initial version

Step 1: Hypothesis
- Currently, the headbar holder is a solid piece of metal that doesn't counter any misplacements of the headposts, nor measure the amount of strain on it. However, I think it is possible to implement an adjustable angle of the headpost and a headstrain gage.
- This would enable a measure for animal discomfort during experimentations, as well as, reduce the effect of human mistakes.

Step 2: Test
- To verify that, we will first replicate the metal headbarholder holder in 3D printed form. ![](https://i.imgur.com/utDB8dR.png)

- â‚¬
- Current version is reliable to work, but doesn't implement the above mentioned improvements.

Step 3: Metric
- Similarity to the original.

Step 4: Criteria
- We are right if the intial version can safely hold a mouse with headpost.
